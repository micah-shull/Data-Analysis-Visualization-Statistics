### **README Documentation: Statistics and Hypothesis Testing**  

Welcome to the **Statistics and Hypothesis Testing** repository, showcasing my expertise in statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and data-driven decision-making. This repository highlights real-world applications of statistics, including data exploration, hypothesis testing, and actionable insights across diverse datasets.

#### **Key Features**  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
   - Comprehensive data exploration using boxplots, KDE plots, and barplots to uncover data trends, identify outliers, and evaluate distributions.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Calculated key metrics like mean, median, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and interquartile range (IQR) to summarize data properties.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Implemented rigorous statistical tests including:
     - **t-tests**: One-sample, two-sample, and paired t-tests for comparing means.  
     - **ANOVA**: One-way and Welch’s ANOVA for comparing group means across multiple categories.  
     - **Non-parametric Tests**: Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s test for data not meeting normality assumptions.  
   - Applied post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey’s HSD, Games-Howell) to identify significant pairwise differences.  

4. **Variance Testing**  
   - Conducted Levene’s Test and F-Test to assess homogeneity of variances, ensuring proper test selection.  

5. **Actionable Insights**  
   - Interpreted statistical results with clarity, highlighting significant group differences, effect sizes (Cohen’s \(d\), Hedges’ \(g\)), and their implications.  

6. **Real-World Applications**  
   - Analyzed well-known datasets like **Iris**, **Penguins**, and **Tips**, demonstrating statistical methodologies in domains such as customer segmentation, product analysis, and experimental design.  

7. **Reproducible Workflows**  
   - Streamlined statistical workflows in Python using Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, ensuring reproducibility and ease of use.
