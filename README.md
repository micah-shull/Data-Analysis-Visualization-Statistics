Introduction to Statistics
Why Are Statistics a Valuable Tool?
Foundation of Data Analysis:

Statistics are the backbone of exploratory data analysis (EDA), providing clarity and direction before diving into advanced modeling techniques.
Data-Driven Decision Making:

Statistical methods ensure decisions are backed by rigorous, evidence-based analyses, reducing the risk of bias or error.
Universal Applicability:

From business to healthcare to technology, statistics play a critical role in solving real-world problems by transforming data into actionable insights.
Bridging Exploration and Modeling:

A thorough statistical understanding of a dataset lays the groundwork for building predictive models and conducting machine learning tasks.
